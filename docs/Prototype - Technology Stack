Prototype - Technology Stack

<<<<<<< HEAD
We are using the JavaScript MEAN Stack for this project. We chose this technology stack because JavaScript is the best choice for the front end and using it on the back end simplifies the project's workflow. Secondly, because we are interacting with APIs, which primarily return JSON objects, using the JavaScript MEAN Stack facilitates ease of use. Thirdly, using a NoSQL database like MongoDB is easier to implement than a SQL database because it requires less schema design, and you can insert most types of data. It is also more scalable. Finally, we chose the MEAN Stack because a couple of us already knew JavaScript so this language would feel familiar for us to work in. The reason we didn't choose another language on the backend like Python and the Django framework for example, is because we wanted to match the language on the frontend with the backend. Using a non-JavaScript language on the backend would require knowledge of how to integrate the two and also would give us more things to learn. This is how we came to the conclusion to use the JavaScript MEAN Stack.

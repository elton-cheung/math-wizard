#### Previous Idea User Stories:
1) As a logged-in user, I want to search travel locales and view real-time tweets, activities, weather, reviews, and other information about that locale, in one place.<br><br>
a) The user can search for travel locales if they have a specific locale in mind, or our app can generate popular locales for the user to choose from.<br><br>
b) Once a locale is selected, a new view is populated, showing different kinds of useful information, such as real-time tweets, recommended activities, recent reviews, and current weather.
2) As a logged-in user, I want to upvote or downvote, and leave comments on locales and activities to offer a sense of popularity.<br><br>
a) Upvotes and downvotes can give this platform an additional way to gauge popularity of activities and make recommendations to users.

3) As a logged-in user, I want the application to generate recommended activities based on social media profile, rather than setting manual filters.<br><br>
a) If the user connects their Facebook, our app can access their check-ins to come up with activities that the user might enjoy.<br><br>
b) If we want to develop the social media profiling further, the user could connect through Instagram too.
4) As a logged-in user, I want to create a personal profile on this application.<br><br>
a) I want to save locales and activities that I want to look at in future sessions.<br><br>
b) I want to log locales and activities that Iâ€™ve done in the past.<br><br>
c) I want to upload a profile photo.

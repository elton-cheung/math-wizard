User Stories

1) As a logged-in user, I want to search travel locales and view real-time tweets, activities, weather, reviews, and other information about that locale, in one place.
a) The user can search for travel locales if they have a specific locale in mind, or our app can generate popular locales for the user to choose from.
b) Once a locale is selected, a new view is populated, showing different kinds of useful information, such as real-time tweets, recommended activities, recent reviews, and current weather.
2) As a logged-in user, I want to upvote or downvote, and leave comments on locales and activities to offer a sense of popularity.
a) Upvotes and downvotes can give this platform an additional way to gauge popularity of activities and make recommendations to users.
3) As a logged-in user, I want the application to generate recommended activities based on social media profile, rather than setting manual filters.
a) If the user connects their Facebook, our app can access their check-ins to come up with activities that the user might enjoy.
b) If we want to develop the social media profiling further, the user could connect through Instagram too.
4) As a logged-in user, I want to create a personal profile on this application.
a) I want to save locales and activities that I want to look at in future sessions.
b) I want to log locales and activities that Iâ€™ve done in the past.
c) I want to upload a profile photo.

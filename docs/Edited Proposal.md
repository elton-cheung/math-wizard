Edited Proposal (11/1)

Because we didn't like our original idea, we decided to pivot and design a different project. This project is a math problem solver. Using our app, you upload a picture of a math problem, perhaps scribbled in your notebook, or it's a problem in a textbook, and the app will solve it for you. This works because the picture is routed to an image recognition API called MathPix, which works specifically on mathematical symbols and such text. It parses the image into text and passes the text into the Wolfram-Alpha API which solves mathematical equations or problems using their software. Finally, we display the answer and related steps to get there, back to the user. This handy application helps students solve hard math problems, especially when they are handwritten and perhaps time-consuming or tedious to type into Wolfram-Alpha.
